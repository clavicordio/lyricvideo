A lump of sadness\nin my brain`0:40:00`0:45:00
I sneeze it out\nand float away`0:45:01`0:50:00
I see the moonlight\nthrough the mist`0:50:01`0:55:00
It's like a train\nthat I have missed`0:55:01`1:00:00
I fly to the theater\nof my dreams`1:09:01`1:14:00
And try to peep\nbehind the scenes`1:14:01`1:19:00
The sky is washed with\nstarlight bleach`1:19:01`1:24:00
Intangible\nand out of reach`1:24:01`1:29:00
